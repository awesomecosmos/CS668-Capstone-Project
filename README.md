# CS668-Capstone-Project

Repository for storing code for my MS in Data Science course CS668 Capstone Project at Pace University. 

**Course Description:** The purpose of the Analytics Capstone Project is for students to apply the knowledge and skills acquired during their master's program to a project involving actual data in a real world setting. During the project, students will apply the entire data science process from identifying a problem or opportunity and collecting and processing actual data to applying suitable and appropriate analytic methods to find a solution. Both the problem statement for the project and the datasets will come from real-world domains similar to those that students might typically encounter within industry, government, or academic research. The course will culminate with each student making a presentation and submitting a final poster/paper and an associate notebook or code.

## Research Question
Can we predict the likelihood of someone switching jobs from academia to industry, or public sector to industry, and vice-versa, based on their characteristics?
