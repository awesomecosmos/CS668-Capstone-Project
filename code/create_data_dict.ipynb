The original variable identifying individuals uniquely across samples is composed of alpha-numerics, whereas PERSONID used an algorithm to create unique numeric values for each individual.  Each digit was expanded to 2 digits.  Numeric digits were given a leading zero.  For example, the digit 2 would be converted to 02.  Letters would be converted by the ordinal of the letter plus ten.  For example, A would be converted to 11, B to 12, C to 13 and so on.  It is possible to identify individuals in different survey years within the same decade.\\n\\nIPUMS-SESTAT has set PERSONID as a character string for statistical packages to more easily read in the values.\\n\\nUsers should note that some respondents are interviewed over time, allowing the possibility for longitudinal data analysis.

For example, A would be converted to 11, B to 12, C to 13 and so on.

The original variable identifying individuals uniquely across samples is composed of alpha-numerics, whereas PERSONID used an algorithm to create unique numeric values for each individual.  Each digit was expanded to 2 digits.  Numeric digits were given a leading zero.  For example, the digit 2 would be converted to 02.  Letters would be converted by the ordinal of the letter plus ten.  For example, A would be converted to 11, B to 12, C to 13 and so on.  It is possible to identify individuals in different survey years within the same decade.\\n\\nIPUMS-SESTAT has set PERSONID as a character string for statistical packages to more easily read in the values.\\n\\nUsers should note that some respondents are interviewed over time, allowing the possibility for longitudinal data analysis.
